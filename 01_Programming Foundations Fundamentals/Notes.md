## what is programming?

Programming is the process of converting ideas into instructions that a computer can understand and execute. These instructions are specific and sequential. You can think of it like a recipe.

- **Bug** is when something unexpected happens
- **crash** is when your program stops early or freezes

> order matters sequential

## programming language

- syntax of c++

  ```
  #include int main() {
    std:cout <Â« "Hello, world!";
    return 0; }
  ```

- syntax of javascript
  ```
  document.write('Hello, world!');
  ```
- syntax of python
  ```
  print('Hello, world!');
  ```

`note`
each language comes with strength and weaknesses

- the goal of theses languages to transfer this to Machine Language

- Python is an interpretive language. This means we have to interpret it into machine code

---

## convert sourch code to machine code

what compilers do. They take your high level programming language and turn it into an executable that contains low level machine code. This way, users can run your code on their machine without every needing your original source code.

what computer interpreters do: they process your source code each times its run, line by line, and it's up to the other user to have the needed interpreter available on their machine.

- languages like C, C++, and Objective-C are known as compiled languages,

- whereas PHP and JavaScript are known as interpretive languages.

- Java, C# and Python use the combination approach.

## IDE

integrated development environments

## running python on CLI

- enter python >> python3 python-file
- exit python >> exit() or ctrl+d
- enter python >> python3

---

## Errors

#### Errors Categories:

- Syntax - language rules broken
- Runtime - unable to execute, ex: (division by zero)
- Semantic - unexpected output

**syntax** : refers to the rules of a programming language.

- Syntax errors happen when you write code that breaks the expected rules.

---

## operators

- Arethmatic operators: + - \* / ...

## variables & datatypes

data types: allows us to put our variable in a particular category so that the computer knows how much space to give us in its memory.

variable names should contain only letters, numbers, and underscores. And even though numbers are allowed, the name shouldn't start with a number.

## conditional

statements that are grouped together this way in programming. It's called a **block**.

## function

A function is a block of code packaged together with a name.

void function : don't return a value after the function executes
